# DataScience_Customers_Clustering
The aim of the project is to group customers of an online store based on customer data.

Online shop customers data set features:
* CustomerID - unique identifier of the customer
* Profit - what profitability does the customer bring, value without units, the higher the value the better
* Recency - how many days ago was the client's last order, quantity in days, the lower the value the better
* Frequency - how often the client ordered products, value without units, the higher the value the better
* Monetary - total value of the products ordered by the client, unit PLN, the higher the value the better
* Variance - number of different products ordered by a client, value without a unit, the higher the value the better

Unsupervised machine learning algorithms used in the project:
1. DBSCAN - data set outliers detection
2. Principal Componet Analysis (PCA) - feature engineering and data visualization
3. K-Means Clustering - grouping/clustering of a data set
